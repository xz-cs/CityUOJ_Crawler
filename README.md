### Description

A crawler that can do crawling, submitting, checking and downloading for you on [CityU ACM OJ](http://acm.cs.cityu.edu.hk/oj2/).

Please make sure that you are within CityU campus network (or connect to CityU VPN) before running the program.

You may need to install relevant libraries (e.g. bs4, requests) prior to running.

From command line, input `python3 Main.py` in the project folder to run it. DO NOT USE IDLE to run the program!

Log in with your EID or Username or Email. For safety, password is prompted without echoing. 

If you want to auto login every time, create a 'login.txt' in the project folder and put your username and password in the 1st and 2nd line. 

If 'login.txt' is not found, you will be prompted to enter login credentials.
